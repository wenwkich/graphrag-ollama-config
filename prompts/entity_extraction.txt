-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, first identify all entities needed from the text in order to capture the information and ideas in the text.
Next, report all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
 Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in This text excerpt delves into the nature of risk in investing, drawing parallels between investor behavior and mountaineering. 

Here's a breakdown of the key points:

**Leveraged Investing & The Credit Crisis:**

* The passage begins by illustrating how leveraged investing can amplify both gains and losses. During the credit crisis, investors who had borrowed heavily to buy bank loans suffered significant losses when loan prices plummeted.
* This highlights the inherent risk in using leverage, as even seemingly safe investments can become highly volatile during market downturns.

**Warren Buffett's Approach:**

* The excerpt then introduces Warren Buffett's philosophy of investing, emphasizing patience and selectivity. 
* He compares investing to baseball, where investors don't need to swing at every pitch but wait for the "perfect" opportunity. This analogy underscores the importance of discipline and avoiding impulsive decisions.

**Nassim Taleb's "I Don't Know":**

* The text introduces Nassim Taleb's concept of "alternative histories," which emphasizes the unpredictable nature of events and their impact on investment outcomes.
* Taleb argues that investors often overestimate their ability to predict the future, leading them to make decisions based on incomplete information. His "I don't know" approach encourages humility and recognizing the inherent uncertainty in investing.

**Risk Control & Moral Hazard:**

* The passage criticizes the common belief that risk can be effectively controlled through sophisticated strategies and tools.
* It draws a parallel between avalanche safety gear and financial risk management, suggesting that increased safety measures can lead to complacency and ultimately increase risk-taking behavior.

The text argues that true risk management in investing involves recognizing the limitations of prediction, avoiding excessive leverage, and maintaining a disciplined approach based on patience and selectivity.

Example 1:

text:
 who might be perfectly happy with their lot in isolation become miserable when they see others do better. In the world of investing, most people find it terribly hard to sit by and watch while others make more money than they do.

I know of a nonprofit institution whose endowment earned 16 percent a year from June 1994 to June 1999, but since its peers averaged 23 percent, the people involved with the endowment were dejected. Without growth stocks, technology stocks, buyouts and venture capital, the endowment was entirely out of step for half a decade. But then the tech stocks collapsed, and from June 2000 to June 2003 the institution earned 3 percent a year while most endowments suffered losses. The stakeholders were thrilled.

There’s something wrong with this picture. How can people be unhappy making 16 percent a year and happy making 3 percent? The answer lies in the tendency to compare ourselves to others and the deleterious impact this
